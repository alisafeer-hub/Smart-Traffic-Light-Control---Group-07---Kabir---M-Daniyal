Algorithm: Smart Traffic Light Control Using Machine Learning

Title: Smart Traffic Light Control — Algorithm Workflow

Step 1: Data Collection

Collect traffic data from:

Custom traffic dataset (your own input)

Kaggle Traffic Prediction Dataset

Data includes:

Cars per lane (North, East, West, South)

Arrival rates per lane

Time stamps

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent data

Normalize traffic counts and arrival rates

Encode categorical features if any

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)

Step 3: Model Training

Train three machine learning models:

Random Forest (Ensemble of decision trees)

Deep Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning)

Deep Neural Network (DNN)

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy

Reward optimization (for RL)

Loss and prediction error

Step 4: Model Evaluation & Selection

Compare all three models

Select the best performing model (Random Forest)

Metrics considered:

Highest accuracy

Real-time prediction stability

Scalability

Step 5: Real-Time Prediction

Input live traffic data (cars and arrival rates per lane)

Predict next green signal using the selected model

Determine traffic density:

Low, Medium, High, Extreme

Step 6: Adaptive Signal Control

Assign green light to lane with highest traffic need

Update traffic light timing dynamically

Loop continues for continuous traffic flow optimization

Step 7: Optional Future Enhancements

Integrate IoT sensors for real-time vehicle counting

Connect to live camera feeds with OpenCV

Apply CNN for vehicle detection

Centralized control for multiple intersections

Visual Diagram Idea

Use boxes for each step

Arrows connecting each step sequentially

Highlight “Model Training & Selection” as the core block

Optional side blocks for datasets and future enhancements
